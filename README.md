# Event Attendance Application (EAA)
A web application to manage event attendee and the event. Made with Rails. This is just a personal project for me to expand my Rails's knowledge and skill.

## Requirements
* A PC or something equivalent
* A text editor
* Ruby 2.5.5 (or newer)
* Rails 5.2.4
* SQLite 3 (Will probably change to PostgreSQL sometime later in the future)

## Installation
1. Clone or Download the files.
2. Open the folder/workspace with text editor.
3. Run `bundler install` with your console command in the workspace/folder's directory.
4. Run `rails db:migrate`

## Support
You may look for documentations online or other sites or open an issue. These may help:
* [Rails Documentation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/)
* [Ruby Documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/)
* Open an issue to ask me directly 

## Contributing
Pull Requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

- Dashboard (still need ideas)
